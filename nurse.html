      "what is a biomedical robot": "A biomedical robot is a device designed to assist in healthcare tasks, such as surgery or patient care. It's an innovation that merges engineering and medicine.",
      "what is your purpose": "My purpose is to simulate a biomedical assistant. I am here to help answer your questions and assist with biomedical tasks.",
      "what can you do": "I can provide information, simulate tasks for healthcare assistance, and respond to your commands. Think of me as a friendly helper.",
      "tell me something interesting": "Did you know that robotic surgery allows for minimally invasive procedures, leading to quicker recovery times and less pain for patients?",
      "how does the heart pump blood": "The heart pumps blood by contracting its chambers. Oxygen-poor blood enters the right side, gets sent to the lungs to pick up oxygen, and then the oxygen-rich blood is pumped to the body by the left side of the heart.",
      "what is the role of red blood cells": "Red blood cells transport oxygen from the lungs to the body's tissues and carry carbon dioxide back to the lungs for exhalation.",
      "what is blood pressure": "Blood pressure is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps. It's essential for circulating blood throughout the body.",
      "how does oxygen travel in the blood": "Oxygen binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells, allowing it to be transported from the lungs to tissues throughout the body.",
      "what is the function of platelets": "Platelets help in blood clotting, preventing excessive bleeding when you have an injury.",
      "what is the importance of the circulatory system": "The circulatory system is crucial for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body, maintaining homeostasis.",
